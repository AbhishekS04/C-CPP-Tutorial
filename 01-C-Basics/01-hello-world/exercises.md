## 🔨 Compilation and Testing

### Building Your Solutions

For each exercise, create a separate C file (e.g., `exercise1.c`, `exercise2.c`, etc.).

**Basic compilation:**
```bash
gcc exercise1.c -o exercise1
./exercise1
```

**With warnings and debugging:**
```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -g exercise1.c -o exercise1
```

### Testing Checklist

For each exercise, verify:
- [ ] Program compiles without warnings
- [ ] Output matches expected format
- [ ] Program runs without crashes
- [ ] All requirements are met
- [ ] Code is properly documented

### Example Test Commands

```bash
# Compile all exercises
gcc -Wall -Wextra -g exercise1.c -o ex1
gcc -Wall -Wextra -g exercise2.c -o ex2
gcc -Wall -Wextra -g exercise3.c -o ex3

# Run all exercises
./ex1
./ex2
./ex3
```

## 💡 Tips for Success

### For Beginners
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic exercises and gradually increase complexity
2. **Type Code**: Don't copy-paste; type each program to build muscle memory
3. **Experiment**: Try changing parts of the code to see what happens
4. **Read Errors**: Compiler errors are your friends - they tell you exactly what's wrong

### For All Levels
1. **Plan First**: Sketch your output on paper before coding
2. **Test Frequently**: Compile and run after each small change
3. **Use Comments**: Document your code as you write it
4. **Format Consistently**: Proper indentation makes code readable

### Debugging Tips
1. **Check Semicolons**: Make sure every statement ends with `;`
2. **Match Braces**: Every `{` needs a corresponding `}`
3. **Include Headers**: Don't forget `#include <stdio.h>`
4. **Check printf**: Make sure format strings are correct
