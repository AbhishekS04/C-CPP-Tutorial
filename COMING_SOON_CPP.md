## 🎪 Sneak Peek: Your First C++ Program

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Student {
private:
    string name;
    int age;
    float gpa;

public:
    // Constructor
    Student(string n, int a, float g) : name(n), age(a), gpa(g) {}
    
    // Method to display student info
    void displayInfo() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
        cout << "Age: " << age << endl;
        cout << "GPA: " << gpa << endl;
    }
    
    // Getter methods
    string getName() { return name; }
    float getGPA() { return gpa; }
};

int main() {
    // Create student objects
    Student student1("Alice", 20, 3.8);
    Student student2("Bob", 19, 3.6);
    
    cout << "=== STUDENT INFORMATION ===" << endl;
    student1.displayInfo();
    cout << endl;
    student2.displayInfo();
    
    return 0;
}
```
